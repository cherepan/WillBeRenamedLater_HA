##  Prof. John Smith ‚Äî Negative Experience

- **Institution:** Department of Physics, Imaginary University
- **Position:** Postdoctoral Researcher
- **Period:** 2020‚Äì2022

### üßæExperience

I joined Prof. Smith's group expecting serious collaboration.  
Instead, I encountered:

- Constant overtime work with no acknowledgment
- Lack of authorship on papers I contributed to
- Hostile behavior toward questions or disagreement
- Public humiliation during group meetings
- No support for career development or networking

Multiple postdocs left before their contracts ended.  
The lab functions as a publication machine with no regard for well-being.

### ‚ùó Recommendation

**Would you recommend this PI/lab to others?**  
** No. Strongly advise against.**
