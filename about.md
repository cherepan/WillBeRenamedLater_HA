#  About Academic Blacklist

Academic Blacklist is a **community-driven platform** created to support **postdoctoral researchers**, PhD students, and early-career scientists in navigating the power imbalances of academia.

The idea is simple: we **share real experiences** — anonymously or openly — about academic supervisors, labs, and working conditions.

---

## ❗ Why this matters

Postdocs and junior researchers are often vulnerable:

- No HR protection
- No job security
- No voice in abusive or exploitative situations

Meanwhile, toxic supervisors continue to receive funding, promotions, and visibility — with no accountability.

This platform exists to **break the silence** and protect others from repeating harmful experiences.

---

##  What this project is NOT

-  It is **not a platform for personal revenge**  
-  It is **not a place for defamation**  
-  It does **not accept unverified attacks or slander**

All submissions are reviewed and published with **moderation** and with a focus on **patterns** and **systemic behavior**, not isolated conflicts.

---

##  What we believe in

- Academic work should be based on **ethics, curiosity, and respect**
- Researchers deserve to know **what kind of environment** they are entering
- Transparency **empowers** the community
- Anonymous testimony is sometimes the **only safe option**

---

##  Anonymity and moderation

- You can submit reviews **anonymously**, without logging in
- Submissions are **manually reviewed** to filter hate speech or personal attacks
- If you are named in a review and wish to respond, you can contact us for a **public reply option**
