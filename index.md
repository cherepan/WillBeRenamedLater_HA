# Honest Academia

_A platform for postdocs and researchers to share experiences with academic supervisors — both positive and negative._

---

## What is this?

This site aims to provide transparency in academia by publishing anonymous or signed reviews about professors and research groups.  
The goal is to protect early-career researchers from toxic work environments and promote ethical mentoring practices.
